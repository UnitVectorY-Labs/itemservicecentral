# itemservicecentral

itemservicecentral helps stand up backend APIs faster by turning a small YAML configuration into a JSON Schema validated REST API with PostgreSQL JSONB storage and JWT based access control.

## Why Teams Use It

- **Move faster**: define resources once and get create, read, update, delete, and query behavior without writing custom endpoint code for each entity.
- **Stay consistent**: every resource follows the same API conventions, so clients and operators have fewer surprises.
- **Keep control**: key rules and payload validation are centralized in configuration, which makes behavior easy to reason about and review.
- **Fit modern operations**: environment-variable friendly configuration and container-first delivery make it straightforward to run in CI/CD and cloud platforms.

## What You Get

- A single service that can host many resources.
- Predictable and repeatable API behavior across data types.
- A standard set of CRUD APIs for each resource
